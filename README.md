# Crop Physiology - Goiás Verde

> An open-source interactive web platform for exploratory data analysis, spatial modeling, and machine learning of crop ecophysiological parameters (soybean and sugarcane).

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains the Streamlit application developed to consolidate the cleaning, descriptive analysis, predictive modeling, and geospatial modeling workflow of **Crop Physiology** field datasets. The application validates data collected by photosynthesis systems (IRGA), chlorophyll meters, and ceptometers, applying an automated pipeline for cleaning and advanced analysis.

The tool is dataset-agnostic, provided the spreadsheet columns map correctly to the expected variables (e.g., photosynthesis rate `A`, transpiration `E`, stomatal conductance `gs`, chlorophylls, leaf area index `LAI/IAF`, etc.).

## 🛠️ Main Features

1.  **Ingestion & Schema Validation** — Ingestion of Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) or CSV files with real-time validation against a 31-column physiological schema categorized by priority (*Required*, *Recommended*, *Optional*). It performs type coercion checks and geographic coordinate limits validation.
2.  **Cleaning Pipeline** — Transparent application of reactive filters: column removal, deselecting records without essential metadata, eliminating empty grid points, and **5 modes of replicate treatment** (mean average, replica expansion into independent rows via `melt`, or single replicate selection).
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Complete descriptive statistics, data completeness checks, histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall), category composition, normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling, D'Agostino-Pearson), multicollinearity (VIF), hotspot rankings, and a multi-method outlier consensus audit.
4.  **Regression** — Bivariate regression fitting with presets tailored for crop physiology (e.g., *gs vs. A*, *Ci vs. A*, *gs vs. E*) with support for confidence intervals and faceting.
5.  **Predictive Modeling** — Training and evaluation of machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, KNN) to estimate the photosynthetic rate `A` based on other parameters, featuring cross-validation metrics, holdout validation, and feature importance charts.
6.  **Spatial Analysis** — Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation, spatial autocorrelation via global Moran's I and local LISA (map of significant clusters), Getis-Ord Gi* hotspots, regular UTM grid cells aggregation, Ordinary Kriging with a fitted spherical variogram model, and a point-distribution map overlaid on Rio Verde (GO) municipal boundaries (via the `geobr` library).
7.  **Time Series** — Daily aggregation and STL time series decomposition (Trend, Seasonal, and Residuals).
8.  **Group Comparison** — Statistical comparisons between groups (e.g., soybean vs. sugarcane) using the Mann-Whitney U test, log-linear regression, and cumulative hourly profiles.
